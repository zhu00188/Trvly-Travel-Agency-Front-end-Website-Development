                                            <p>Booking is easy! Browse our tours online, select your preferred departure
                                                date, and click "Book Now." You'll need to fill out a booking form with
                                                traveler details and pay a deposit (typically 20-30% of total cost).
                                                Full payment is usually due 60 days before departure. You can also call
                                                our booking team for personalized assistance or to discuss custom
                                                itineraries.</p>

                                            <h6>What is your cancellation policy?</h6>
                                            <p>Cancellations made 90+ days before departure receive a full refund minus
                                                a $200 administrative fee. 60-89 days: 50% refund. 30-59 days: 25%
                                                refund. Less than 30 days: no refund. We strongly recommend purchasing
                                                travel insurance to protect your investment. Cancellations must be
                                                submitted in writing via email. Refunds are processed within 14 business

                                            <h6>Can I change my tour dates after booking?</h6>
                                            <p class="mb-0">Yes! Date changes are subject to availability and must be
                                                requested at least 60 days before departure. One free date change is
                                                allowed per booking; subsequent changes incur a $150 modification fee.
                                                If the new tour has a higher price, you'll pay the difference. If it's
                                                lower priced, the difference is non-refundable but can be applied as
                                                credit toward future bookings within one year.</p>
