                Designing a Smooth Digital Experience for Travel Discovery
            </h2>
            <p class="section-subtitle">
                Trvly was developed to address usability challenges commonly found in travel platforms, particularly
                during the discovery and comparison stages. Users often face large volumes of options, inconsistent
                filtering systems, and unclear information hierarchy before reaching a booking decision. This project
                organizes destination search, tour filtering, and curated travel content within a responsive interface
                designed to support informed planning rather than transactional checkout alone.

            </p>
            <div class="overview-grid">
                <div class="overview-card">
                    <h3>Project Purpose</h3>
                    <p>The purpose of Trvly was to improve user decision-making in the pre-booking phase of the travel
                        journey. The platform emphasizes search, comparison, and planning by aligning content structure
                        with core user tasks and reducing cognitive overload through prioritization and layout control.
                        The booking-related features are implemented as interface simulations to evaluate interaction
                        logic and user flow rather than to function as a production-level transactional system.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="overview-card">
                    <h3>Core Challenges</h3>
                    <p>
                        The primary challenge was maintaining visual interest while preserving readability and
                        functional clarity. The platform needed to support multiple user intents, including exploration,
                        comparison, and itinerary planning, without overwhelming the interface. Another key
                        consideration was meeting WCAG and AODA accessibility requirements while maintaining
                        consistent hierarchy across large content sets and reusable components.

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="overview-card">
                    <h3>Delivered Results</h3>
                    <p>
                        The final implementation includes a mobile-first responsive interface built with Bootstrap 4 and
                        custom styling, a reusable component system with more than 40 UI elements, and simulated
                        flows for destination discovery, tour planning, booking, payments, reviews, and user dashboards.
                        The design and front-end code align with WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA accessibility guidelines to
                        support
                        keyboard navigation, appropriate contrast ratios, and semantic structure.

                        Key Challenges
                    </h3>
                    <ul class="challenge-list">
                        <li><strong>Competitive Travel Market:</strong>
                            The website needed to communicate credibility and clarity within a market dominated by
                            large booking services. The interface had to support trust and ease of navigation without
                            relying on complex or cluttered layouts.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Diverse User Goals:</strong>
                            Users arrive with different intentions, ranging from casual exploration to detailed
                            comparison. The experience had to accommodate multiple planning behaviors while maintaining
                            consistent navigation logic.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Mobile‑First Expectations:</strong>
                            A significant portion of travel research occurs on mobile devices. Responsive behavior,
                            performance optimization, and touch interaction design were essential to ensure usability
                            across screen sizes.

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Accessibility Gaps:</strong>
                            Many travel platforms do not meet accessibility standards, creating barriers for users
                            relying on assistive technologies. The project required accessibility to be addressed at
                            both design and code levels.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Long-Term Scalability:</strong>The system had to support future expansion in
                            destinations, tour types, content, and user features without requiring structural redesign.
                        </li>

                    <ul class="solution-list">
                        <li><strong>Front-End–Driven Platform Design:</strong>
                            The platform was designed around discovery, comparison, and planning rather than
                            transactional booking. This approach aligns the interface with early-stage user
                            decision-making behavior.

                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Clear Information Architecture & User Flows:</strong>
                            A clear page hierarchy and navigation framework were defined across destinations, tours,
                            blogs, and user accounts. User flows were mapped to support predictable movement between
                            exploration and evaluation stages.
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Mobile-First Responsive Layout:</strong>
                            A responsive layout was implemented using Bootstrap 4 with custom styling to maintain
                            consistent readability and interaction behavior across devices.
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Accessibility-First Implementation:</strong>
                            WCAG 2.1/2.2 Level AA standards, along with AODA principles, were applied through semantic
                            HTML, ARIA labeling, keyboard-accessible components, and contrast-compliant color usage.
                        </li>

                        <li><strong>Component-Based UI System:</strong>
                            More than 40 reusable UI components and front-end patterns were developed to support
                            consistency and future backend integration without altering core interface logic.
                        </li>

                                        Alex prefers browsing destinations without a fixed itinerary. He values flexible
                                        filtering, clear visuals, and the ability to compare options independently
                                        before making a decision. The interface needs to support open exploration
                                        without forcing early commitment.

                            Validated layouts and user flows were translated into a responsive front-end using
                            HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript, and jQuery. Development emphasized modular
                            components that support destination discovery, tour filtering, and content-heavy pages
                            such as blogs and travel guides.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Interactive features, including search and filtering by destination, departure location,
                            price range, travel type, and promotional categories, were implemented on the front end
                            to simulate real-world comparison behaviors. Semantic markup, consistent hierarchy, and
                            performance-conscious styling were applied to maintain clarity across dense information
                            pages.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The interface was tested across multiple screen sizes and devices to verify responsive
                            behavior, accessibility, and usability. Key interactions were evaluated to ensure they
                            remained functional and understandable on mobile, tablet, and desktop environments.
